## Astropy
It took me a while to figure out how to install the [development version](https://astropy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/workflow/get_devel_version.html) (which is different from installing the library itself), but it was a quick and easy process after that. I also appreciate that they have a page about the [GitHub workflow](https://astropy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html#workflow) to make changes to their codebase.

## OpenMRS
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to run their core Java app locally. Even after installing all the prerequisites and trying the [build command](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core#build-command) multiple times, I get compilation errors in the `ShoudTaglet.java` file.

## Open Street Map
I'm not sure which specific project we'd like to work on, but [iD](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD), their JavaScript editor for creating and editing features on the map, looks interesting! It was easy to [install and build](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD#installation) locally, and they also have some open issues for [Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest).
