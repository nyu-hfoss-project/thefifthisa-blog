title: ðŸŽƒ Hacktoberfest ðŸŽƒ
---

This weekend, I submitted [my first PR for Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/pull/63)! I found [Spok](https://github.com/magnetis/spok) while digging through the featured projects; it's a Ruby gem that checks if a particular weekday is a holiday or not. Since the creators are based in Brazil, they are asking contributors for holiday calendars from other countries to make their tool more globally responsive. I added one for my home country, the Philippines. The [issue](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/issues/28) was well-documented and they also have a good [contributing guide](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), so the process was pretty straightforward on my end. While I didn't deal with actual code, the experience of contributing still gave me a confidence boost and makes me excited to find new projects to work on.
