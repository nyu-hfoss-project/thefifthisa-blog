This weekend, I submitted [my first PR for Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/pull/63)! I found [Spok](https://github.com/magnetis/spok) while digging through the featured projects; it's a Ruby gem that checks if a particular weekday is a holiday or not. Since the creators are based in Brazil, they are asking contributors for holiday calendars from other countries to make their tool more globally responsive. I added one for my home country, the Philippines. The [issue](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/issues/28) was well-documented and they also have a good [contributing guide](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), so the process was pretty straightforward on my end. While I didn't deal with actual code, the experience of contributing still gave me a confidence boost and makes me excited to find new projects to work on.

**Update**: Submitted [another PR](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/pull/1353)! This time, I worked on refactoring some CSS for Internet Archive's [Open Library](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary), an online catalog that aims to collect every book ever published. I learned about CSS source order and specificity rules, and how [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/no-descending-specificity/) helps keep stylesheets organized given that. I also appreciated that one of the lead developers clearly explained the [issue](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/1119#issuecomment-430052580), which made it easy for me to contribute.
