title: Open Issues in OSM iD
---

A running list of open issues that are possible candidates for contributions:
* [Add relationships to presets](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5326)
	* I really appreciate the clarity of this issue/feature request's documentation. The suggestions under the Future Considerations section are all interesting aspects to explore and seem to be at the level of difficulty we would want to work on for the rest of the semester.
* [Lost touchscreen capability in the map](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5466)
	* My laptop has a touchscreen and I was surprised to find out that I'm experiencing this issue as well. I tried the editor on my phone and it was also unresponsive. I think it would be great to explore how touch-based interactions work and improve the map's accessibility in this way.
* [Turn restriction editor should redraw when the sidebar resizes](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5474)
* [Multiline text fields for long tag values](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5444)
	* These issues seem small but do make noticeable differences in how a user interacts with the map. I have some code from another class that deals with the window resizing problem; we can take a look at that as a starting point.
* [Filter for panoramic streetlevel images](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5433) (connected to [Date filter for street level imagery trips](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/4518))
	* This issue is vague and looks to be more involved than the ones previously mentioned, but I think it would be interesting to figure out how to filter images by date/type.
