title: Open Issues in OSM iD
---

**Updated:** November 7, 2018

A running list of open issues that are possible candidates for contributions:
* [Add relationships to presets](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5326)
	* I really appreciate the clarity of this issue/feature request's documentation. The suggestions under the Future Considerations section are all interesting aspects to explore and seem to be at the level of difficulty/involvement we would want to work on for the rest of the semester.
